I’ve always been interested in coding since I was a little kid. However, drawing was always a main passion of mine because of my easy access to paper and pencils.

While I had a general idea of what coding was and what it entailed, I had limited access to computers and the internet. I only ever really got to use one every two weeks when my class took a trip to the computer lab or for that one month in my early childhood when my dad got a computer and internet connection installed in our house before deciding that we didn’t need the internet enough to keep paying for it.

The computer ended up being turned into a playstation for solitaire and spider before it stopped running a couple of years later. It probably would have lasted longer if my sister didn’t have a habit of periodically kicking the computer tower every time she sat in front of it.

There wasn’t anything strange about the lack of internet in my early years either considering that my childhood took place in the early 2000s. The internet was still a new thing then and it wasn’t something that was necessary to have in every household. So naturally, I ended up focusing more on art than coding.

My interest in coding never really left though. With movies and tv shows playing cool hacker scenes, it always stayed on my radar as something I would like to learn one day. Especially once I got regular access to the internet in my high school years. I wanted to be able to build websites, apps, and software. It seemed like a cool skill to have, but I had already dedicated a majority of my life to art by then.

Later I would enter an art school called the Art Institute of Inland Empire - California that did offer some coding classes, but those classes were for game majors and I wasn’t passionate enough about games to change my major for some coding classes. Art didn’t exactly work out for me either though.

In fact, my school ended up going through the process of being shut down during my last month. I didn’t get any help in landing a career or how to properly do a job interview due to the staff rushing to get new jobs. Some of my friends who still had a couple more years before they could graduate ended up switching to the San Diego campus. However, that school quickly shut down during the school year. One of my friends even told me how the professor came into the classroom one day to announce that the school was closed and they all had to leave. From all my friends who went to the art institute, only two that know got jobs in their fields.

So with one of my career plans burning down in flames, I decided that I really had nothing holding me back from pursuing a different career. Which is what brought me back to my interest in coding. After all, if I’m going to dedicate my life to a new career, it might as well be something I can be equally passionate about. That is why I decided to study software engineering.
